Game App Test

Developer challenge - Pokédex

Hello developers! For this challenge you will build your own Pokédex - a tool used by all pokémon trainers to help them keep track of all the new pokémon they encounter on their journey to become pokémon masters!

Official definition: The Pokédex (ポケモン図鑑, Pokémon Zukan, lit.: Pokémon Encyclopedia) is an electronic device designed to catalog and provide information regarding the various species of Pokémon.


As you know, pokémon trainers travel around the world, catching new pokémon and battling against gym leaders to become the very best. Therefore your pokédex must be a mobile app and it must run on iOS. You can code your app using the technology of your choice: React Native, Swift, Flutter, etc. Choose your own poison! As long as it is to go.


Your pokédex should support the following features:

Save a new Pokémon
The app should… 
1.	Allow trainers to enter the name of a pokémon - Pikachu, Charmander, Firulais…any name.
2.	Allow trainers to take a picture of a pokémon (or their dog) - give the user the option to open their camera or pick a picture from their gallery. 
3.	Allow the user to select 1 or 2 types for each pokémon, from a list of default types. Here are all the types that should be available: 
4.	Allow the user to enter a multiline description of the pokémon - think “fun facts”.
5.	Allow the user to save all the information mentioned in the previous steps - your typical “Save” button.

View all your pokémon
Entering information about pokémon that you find is only half of the job - you need to be able to see it!! 
Once you create a record in your pokédex, there should be a space where trainers can see all the pokémon in a list. Picking a pokémon from that list should take the user to a page that displays all the information about that pokémon.


Additionally, there should be an option to filter pokémon based on their type (e.g. I want to see all FIRE pokémon)

Delivering your project

Bonus points!!!

1.	We care a lot about visuals, so any effort to make the app look good and interesting is well worth it!
2.	If you can share a way for us to run the app ourselves without the need of any  sophisticated software, terminal commands, etc, you’ll move to the beginning of the line :) (think Expo Go and send some basic instructions)
